  about:             |
    I have a B.S. in Exercise Science and am a NCSA CSCS. 
    
    I am also a purple belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu and an Army Airborne Infantry Vet. 
    
    (I just copied this from your insta bio, but you can write a bit more about yourself here, like establish credibility, etc. add whatever info you want about yourself.

    I took the two pictures of you from insta as well since you have them as your profile pics and cropped them, but you can change them or upload the actual image for higher resolution. The background pic is one I took of the gym, but you can change it to be whatever you want. I thought that mats would be appropriate. )
    
    (You should also list what tournaments you have competed in and won.)
