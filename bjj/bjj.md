I will work on this format later. 

## BJJ

Here you can post whatever you want related to bjj. You can post videos of matches from competitions and maybe do some analysis on them. You can post some of your favorite drills. You can post reviews of places you've gone to train or where you will be competing next. You can talk about how some of the grappling workouts you write about in the Fitness section relate to moves/drills in actual grappling. You can talk about wrestling here and fundamentals.

You can also talk about strategies for competitions and how to score the most points, or sequences of moves that you like to do. 

Maybe you can write something about the different components of bjj, like what it is and what are some fundamentals to know.
