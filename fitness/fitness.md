I will work on this format later. 

## Fitness

Here you can post different workouts that you do. You can organize the posts however you'd like, but it might be easier to just post workouts that you like to do and explain what they are useful for. 

For example, if you go to the gym after class and do some grappling specific workouts, you can make a post about those. You can be breif and do it in a list form and maybe describe some of the workouts if they are nonstandard. You should also include pics/vids to supplement the workouts, esp if they are more niche. You can also make some posts specific to powerlifting or just general fitness. But here you can showcase your knowledge on fitness.
