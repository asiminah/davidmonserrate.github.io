## Goal

Welcome to your website. I thought that for many reasons it would be good for you to have a website to give people, even if it doesn't have much on it. You can put the link in your bio on insta, fb, etc. If you meet anyone in the gym and they want your advice or something, you can give them your site. You can then write work out plans for people and charge them. 
If you want to reach out to any potential sponsors, you can also give them your site so they can learn more about you. 
I did a lot of the coding and formatting for it so that you can add the content. You don't need to spend a lot of time writing things or adding to it. 
The idea is like, if you go to the gym and have a routine, you can write down your workout, take some pics/vids, and then post it (I can do all of the formatting). 
Or if you are bored at work, you can just write down a paragraph or two with some knowledge about nutrition or rehab or whatever and you can include links to other sites or something. 
The idea is that slowly over time the site will build itself. You probably don't have time to think about this or work on any of it now, but if you want I can leave detailed comments on how to edit the code, make a post, etc, or I can show you another time when you would like to start working on it. Alternatively, you can write things down in notes or on paper and send it to me and I can take care of the rest. 
Once you have read all of my comments to you, I can comment them out so that they are in the code, but not published. I think that you should write something for the "about" page (that's the link associated to your name on the side bar) and you should write something for the "contact" page. Then I can hide the other tabs until we fix them. That way in the meantime you can use the website without it looking incomplete/under construction.

## Information

I have created 5 tabs in the sidebar: Fitness, BJJ, Nutrition, Rehab, and Contact. We can hide whichever you don't want and we can add more if you'd like. I tried to keep it simple.  

In each tab, I put a brief description of what I thought could go there. The format of each page does not need to be the same. For example, some pages can have a blog format, others can have posts with information instead, some can just be lists.
