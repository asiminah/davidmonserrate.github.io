I will work on this format later. 

## Rehab

Here you can talk about your recovery routine, like stretching, cryotherapy, isolation tank, etc. You can explain the difference between an epsom salt bath and an ice bath. You can maybe list some stretches or light exercises that help prevent common injuries in bjj. You can maybe outline what to do to recover if you get certain common injuries in bjj. This section is basically for taking care of your body.
